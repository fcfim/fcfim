### 🚀 About Me

I am a **Civil Engineer** and **Administrator** with a strong background in Software Development.

My journey in the construction industry began in **2014**, starting as a Technician in Buildings (*Técnico em Edificações*). This path took me through engineering firms, architectural offices, and independent consultancy, giving me a deep understanding of the sector's real-world challenges.

Currently, I channel this decade of experience into **Versor Engenharia** and my software projects.

Although I completed most of a **Systems Analysis & Development (ADS)** degree, I pivoted my focus to practical application and product development before graduation. Today, I operate as a Full Stack Developer who understands the business logic and engineering norms behind the code.

### 📐 The Triad of Value

My stack is not just languages; it's a methodology driven by **Versor Engenharia**:

| Vertex | Focus | Why it Matters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **👷🏼‍♂️ Civil Engineering** | `Compliance` `ABNT NBR` `Structural Logic` | Technical accuracy and normative compliance (ABNT NBR). |
| **💼 Business Admin** | `Scalability` `Unit Economics` `Viability` | Focus on economic viability and process optimization. |
| **💻 Full Stack Dev** | `Clean Arch` `Automation` `Interoperability` | Creating tools to automate and solve the industry's specific problems.

### 🌱 Current Focus & Projects

I develop specialized SaaS products and tools to bridge the gap between engineering theory and digital efficiency:

- 🏗️ **Structural & Valuation SaaS (Stealth Mode):** Developing an ecosystem to automate complex structural calculations and real estate appraisals, minimizing human error.
- 🧱 **Engineering APIs:** Writing structural algorithms exposed as documented REST APIs to improve software interoperability.
- 📚 **EdTech for High Performance:** A data-driven platform focused on study planning, execution metrics, and adaptive learning.
- ⚙️ **Process Automation:** Custom scripts to modernize legacy workflows and integrate disconnected systems for public and private sectors.
